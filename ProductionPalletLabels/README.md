# Production Labels Generator Script

A simple VBA macro that can generate a customizable amount of sequentially numbered pallet labels for printing. Activated with shortcut `ctrl`-`shift`-`c`.

Update 2024-05-03: To improve the flexibility of the module, redundancy was sacrificed to copied the macro across all `.xlsm` files. Additional code were added to avoid executing multiple macros with the same name.
